# Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for
# Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type.
# Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of
# information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indi-
# cating that the restaurant is open.
# Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attri-
# butes individually, and then call both methods.
