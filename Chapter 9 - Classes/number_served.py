# Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 166).
# Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0.
# Create an instance called restaurant from this class . Print the
# number of customers the restaurant has served, and then change this
# value and print it again. Add a method called set_number_served() that
# lets you set the number of customers that have been served. Call this
# method with a new number and print the value again.
# Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
# the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any
# number you like that could represent how many customers were served
# in, say, a day of business.
