# Admin: An administrator is a special kind of user. Write a class
# called Admin that inherits from the User class you wrote in Exercise
# 9-3 (page 166) or Exercise 9-5 (page 171). Add an attribute,
# privileges, that stores a list of strings like "can add post", "can
# delete post", "can ban user", and so on. Write a method called
# show_privileges() that lists the administratorâ€™s set of privileges.
# Create an instance of Admin, and call your method.
