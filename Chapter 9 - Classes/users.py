# Users: Make a class called User . Create two attributes called
# first_name and last_name, and then create several other attributes
# that are typically stored in a user profile. Make a method called
# describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information. Make
# another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting
# to the user. Create several instances representing different users,
# and call both methods for each user.
