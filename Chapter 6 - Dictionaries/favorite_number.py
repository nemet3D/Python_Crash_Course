# Favorite Numbers: Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers.
# Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of
# a favorite number for each person, and store each as a value in your
# dictionary. Print each person’s name and their favorite number. For
# even more fun, poll a few friends and get some actual data for your
# program.
