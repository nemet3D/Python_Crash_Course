# Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs
# when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert
# the input to an int , youâ€™ll get a TypeError. Write a program that
# prompts for two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch
# the TypeError if either input value is not a number, and print a
# friendly error message. Test your program by entering two numbers and
# then by entering some text instead of a number.

print("Give me two numbers, and I'll add them.")
