# Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few
# lines summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each
# line with the phrase In Python you can... . Save the file as
# learning_python.txt in the same directory as your exercises from this
# chapter. Write a program that reads the file and prints what you wrote
# three times. Print the contents once by reading in the entire file,
# once by looping over the file object, and once by storing the lines in
# a list and then working with them outside the with block.
